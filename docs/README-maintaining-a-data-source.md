After the [BioThings API of your data-source has been set up and integrated to BTE](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/main/docs/README-contributing-new-data-source.md), you may want to update your data-source, change the code used to generate your API, or adjust the x-bte annotation.

These are some things to keep in mind:

1. If you have a BioThings API hosted by the Service Provider team at the Su / Wu lab, parser + data updates need to be deployed manually (some documentation [here](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/main/docs/README-contributing-new-data-source.md))
    * Deployment is done by someone with access to the BioThings API instances (Everaldo / Johnathan/ Chunlei).
    * Please create an issues at [this Github repo](https://github.com/biothings/pending.api/issues) when deployments are needed. The content of the issue can follow this template:
    > Title: API my_kp update
    > - API URL: https://biothings.ncats.io/my_kp
    > - Github URL: https://github.com/MyLab/MyKP
    > - Git Branch/Commit: Master 12a3b45
    > - No. Documents: 123,456 (with explanation if there is a significant change)
    > - Structure of Documents: (describe the added/deleted fields, or paste the new mapping json below.)
    * Please troubleshoot your code and data first, and make sure all manifests, ES-mapping for fields, etc. are properly updated
    * Deployment workflow in ITRB environments (CI, Test and Prod):
      * If the updated data plugin works without any issue, the updated data will be deployed to ITRB CI environment.
      * Service Provider team will notify on the issue when the updated API is available at the CI host: https://biothings.ci.transltr.io.
        (Please follow the automated notification from the github issue, we won't send additional notifications).
      * Please test your updated API on the CI host.
      * Depending on the release schedule of your team and the overall Translator schedule, please notify us (can also through the same
        github issue) when you want to deploy to Test and/or Prod environments. We will NOT deploy unless received a request from you.
      * When deployed to Test or Prod, we will notify on the Github issue again, so you can verify the new release.
2. In almost all cases: the yaml file connected to your SmartAPI registration must be updated (some documentation [here](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/main/docs/README-writing-x-bte.md#editing-an-existing-smartapi-yaml)). The x-bte annotation is essential for BTE to access your API and properly process it into TRAPI format (explained in this [guide](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/main/docs/README-types-of-apis.md)).
    * x-bte annotations must be updated for:
        * new combos of subject-category / subject-ID-prefix / predicate / qualifiers / object-category / object-ID-prefix
        * changes that affect querying. Ex: the category or predicate field values have changed, and your x-bte operations set those fields in queries. 
    * The Su team can provide guidance / tips. If you're worried about breaking your API's connection to BTE, we suggest making updates in a branch/PR first, and then [testing](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/main/docs/README-writing-x-bte.md#testing-after-its-written) it.
3. The final step is to refresh the SmartAPI registration. This is done automatically at midnight everyday; or it can be done from your [dashboard](https://smart-api.info/dashboard) if you own this registration; or you can ask someone with access to the SmartAPI service (Marco, Colleen or Chunlei) to refresh your registration. After 10 min or so, BTE will ingest the updated registry and your changes should be live.
