The data are collected by the US Census Bureau and are publicly available.\n\nThe variables are taken from the five-year summary data file of the US Census Bureau ACS, which is constructed from five annual waves of the bureau’s largest household survey. Approximately, two million households have completed the survey annually since calendar year 2005. (Five waves of the survey before 2005 sampled approximately 500,000 households each.) See https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/sample-size/ for more detail. Microdata are available, but small-area data are only available in summary tabulations.\n\nValues are provided at the US Census Block Group level, representing the 2007-2011 and 2012-2016 calendar-year periods for locations within the continental USA. Block groups, the smallest geographic area for which sample survey data are released, generally contain 600 to 3,000 people (e.g., the size of a single city apartment building). Block Groups are aggregates of an average of 39 Blocks each, each of which is delineated by visible and invisible geographic boundaries. Block groups, in turn, are aggregated into Census Tracts, which generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Census Tracts aggregate into counties and counties into states. Metropolitan and micropolitan areas are aggregates of counties. See https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf for further detail. Census geography, even Block Groups, may cross municipal lines and may include both urbanized and rural areas. Because population is a large factor in determining Census geography, some Block Groups may cover an extensive rural or wilderness area while others are quite compact. Census Block, Block Group, and Tract boundaries may change somewhat with each decennial Census, but remain stable in between Censuses.\n\nThe US Census Bureau is mandated to preserve the confidentiality of individual-level data. Therefore, data are often summarized, coarsened into categories, or suppressed by complex secret algorithms (especially, but not limited to household income data). In addition, because the variables of interest may only apply to a small subset of Block Group missing data can occur. In some versions of the data, calculated values are suppressed in Block Groups with less than 50 residents.\n\nStandard errors for the socio-demographic variables are provided. Because each of the values in the ACS data files are summary statistics calculated from sample survey data for each Block Group, different samples yield somewhat different values. Therefore, the Census Bureau generates 80 replicate values for selected variables. These provide the basis for the estimated standard errors of the estimates.\n\nThe currently available variables are listed here:\n\n **(2007-2011 data)**\n- **YEARS** – the range of years for which this census data is valid\n- **GEOID** – a FIPS like code for identifying which census block group this data pertains to, see (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/geoidentifiers.html)\n- **EstTotalPopulation** - estimated population count in block group\n- **MedianHouseholdIncome** - estimated median household income\n- **EstResidentialDensity** - block group population density\n- **EstPropNonHispWhite** – proportion of the block group population that is non-Hispanic white\n- **EstPropPersons5PlusNoEnglish** - proportion of the block group population aged 5 plus sometimes speaking a language other than English at home\n- **EstPropMaleLittleWork** - proportion of block group males aged 16-64 who worked less than 26 weeks in the previous year\n- **EstPropHouseholdsNoAuto** - proportion of the block group households with no automobile\n- **EstPropHouseholdSSI** - proportion of the block group households receiving Supplemental Security Income\n- **EstPropHouseholdPA** - proportion of the block group households receiving Public Assistance\n- **EstPropHighSchoolMaxEducation** - proportion of the block group population aged 25 and up with a HS diploma or less\n- **EstPropHighSchoolDropout** - proportion of the block group 16-19 year olds who are neither attending school nor HS graduates\n- **EstPropHighSchoolDropoutNoWork** - proportion of the block group 16-19 year olds who are neither attending school nor HS graduates and are without work\n- **EstPropFemaleHouseholdNoSpouse** - proportion of the block group family households headed by a female (no male partner present)\n- **EstPropFemaleHouseholdFamilyChild** - proportion of the block group family households headed by a female with related children aged 18 or under (no male partner present)\n- **EstPropFemaleHouseholdAnyChild** - proportion of the block group total households headed by a female with any children aged 18 or less (no male partner present)\n\n **(2012-2016 data)**\n- **YEARS** – the range of years for which this census data is valid\n- **GEOID** – a FIPS like code for identifying which census block group this data pertains to, see (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/geoidentifiers.html)\n- **EstTotalPopulation** - estimated population count in block group\n- **EstTotalPopulation_SE** - standard error of total population in block group\n  -

These data sets provide 8-hour ozone daily maximums (in ppbV) and daily PM2.5 daily averages (in µg/m3). The US EPA provides estimates at the resolution of US Census tract centroids for the continental US. For a given location, the API returns the estimated exposure for the census tract the location occurs in.\n\nThe API provides exposure estimates for calendar years 2002-2016. Resolution for model estimates is 12 km-squared, provisioned at a resolution of the US Census track centroid. The US census tract definition is from the calendar year 2010 definition of the US Census Bureau, for all years of CMAQ data.\n\nThe data sets sources are derived from air quality monitoring data from the National Air Monitoring Stations and Local Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS/LAMS) and numerical output from the Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ - https://www.epa.gov/cmaq).\n\nThe API currently provides the following exposure variables:\n- O3: provides estimated O3 concentration levels. Estimated values are for daily maximums in units of ppbV.\n- PM2.5: provides estimated pm2.5 concentration levels.

WGS84 is the World Geodetic System for expressing latitude and longitude. For example, Raleigh, North Carolina is at latitude 35.7796 and longitude -78.6382.\n\nIn addition to distance, the API retrieves additional information, including the roadway type, the maximum speed limit, the annual average daily traffic (AADT), and the total number of lanes. See https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/pubs/aadt/ for information on how AADT is computed.\n\nThe following roadway types are supported:\n* Off-Network\n* Rural Restricted Access\n* Rural Unrestricted Access\n* Urban Restricted Access\n* Urban Unrestricted Access\n\nIn some cases, roadway type, AADT, and speed are not available in the HPMS data set. In this case, data from the US Census Bureau TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) data set (available at census.gov) was used to obtain roadway type. Roadway segments without roadway type were dropped from the dataset; this amounted to approximately 5% of roadways, many of which had not yet been built. Missing AADT and speeds were populated using a variety of methods. First, a lookup table was built with county averages by roadway type and facility type and populated with values from segments that already had AADT and/or speed. Second, in cases in which the lookup table could not be used (e.g., ramps often didn’t match), speeds were assigned based on the function class of the roadway, state averages, or averages for a similar (but different) roadway type.\n\nThe API is currently restricted to calendar year 2016.\n","license":{"name":"MIT","url":"http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"},"title":"Roadway Exposures API","version":"1.0.0","x-translator":{"component":"KP","team":["Exposures Provider"]}},"paths":{"/distance":{"get":{"description":"Get the distance to the nearest roadway in meters","operationId":"get_distance","parameters":[{"description":"latitude of the location of interest using decimal format (WGS84 datum)","in":"query","name":"latitude","required":true,"schema":{"format":"double","type":"number"}},{"description":"longitude of the location of interest using decimal format (WGS84 datum)","in":"query","name":"longitude","required":true,"schema":{"format":"double","type":"number"}},{"description":"the maximum search distance between the location of interest and nearest road (meters)","in":"query","name":"limit_distance","schema":{"default":500,"format":"double","type":"number"}}],"responses":{"200":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/RoadwayData"}}},"description":"search results matching criteria"},"204":{"content":{},"description":"No content returned - nearest roadway is >500 meters from specified latitude/longitude"},"400":{"content":{},"description":"Bad input parameter"},"404":{"content":{},"description":"No values found"},"500":{"content":{},"description":"Server error"}},"summary":"retrieves distance in meters","x-openapi-router-controller":"swagger_server.controllers.default_controller"}}},"servers":[{"url":"/roadway_proximity_api/v1"}],"tags":[{"name":"translator"}]},{"_id":"bfd371630f0bcb198d428488d061e7b3","_meta":{"date_created":"2020-06-10T20:42:55.836852+00:00","last_updated":"2021-02-17T07:42:12.854226+00:00","url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCATSTranslator/KnowledgeProviderScaffold/master/openapi.yml","username":"MarkDWilliams"},"_score":0.75804067,"info":{"contact":{"email":"mark.williams5@nih.gov","name":"Mark Williams","x-role":"responsible developer"},"description":"a work in progress KP example","termsOfService":"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT","title":"NCATS KP Scaffold","version":"3.0"},"paths":{"/query":{"post":{"responses":{"200":{"description":"A query response object"}},"summary":"POST a ReasonerStdAPI formatted query to the service.

Count and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center's](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/) [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient and outpatient data. Counts are the number of patients associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. Frequencies are the number of unique patients associated with the concept divided by the total number of patients in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records. To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.         \n\nFour datasets are available: \n1) 5-year non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical data from 2013-2017  \n2) lifetime non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical data from all dates  \n3) 5-year hierarchical dataset: Counts for each concept include patients from descendant concepts. Includes clinical data from 2013-2017.\n4) BETA! Temporal co-occurrence data\n\nIn the 5-year hierarchical data set, the counts for each concept include the patients from all descendant concepts. For example, the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes patients with Ibuprofen 600 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019073 patients), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072), Ibuprofen 20 MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc. \n\nWhile the lifetime dataset captures a larger patient population and range of concepts, the 5-year dataset has better underlying data consistency. \n\nClinical concepts (e.g., conditions, procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO). \n\n\nThe following resources are available through this API: \n\n\n1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset descriptions, number of concepts, etc. \n\n\n2. OMOP: Access to the common vocabulary for name and concept identifier mapping\n\n\n3. Clinical Frequencies: Access to the counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of patients with the code(s) / total number of patients. \n\n\n4. Concept Associations: Inferred associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed to expected frequency, and relative frequency. \n\n\nA [Python notebook](https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/cohd_api/blob/master/notebooks/COHD_API_Example.ipynb) demonstrates simple examples of how to use the COHD API.\n\n\nCOHD was developed at the [Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) as a collaboration between the [Weng Lab](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/), [Tatonetti Lab](http://tatonettilab.org/), and the [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) program (Red Team).

Count and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center's](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/) [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient. Counts are the number of inpatient visits associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or a procedure was performed. Frequencies are the number of unique visits associated with the concept divided by the total number of visits in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records. To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.         \n\nDatasets from three primary cohorts are available: \n1) COVID-19: Hospitalized patients aged 18 or older with a COVID-19 related condition diagnosis and/or a confirmed positive COVID-19 test during their hospitalization period or within the prior 21 days. Date range: March 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020. This cohort is also further stratified by sex (male and female) and age (adult: 18-64, senior: 65+).\n2) General inpatient: All hospitalized patients aged 18 or older. Date range: January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019.\n3) Influenza: Hospitalized patients aged 18 or older who had at least one occurrence of influenza conditions or pre-coordinated positive measurements or positive influenza testing in the prior 21 days or during their hospitalization period. Date range: January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019.\n\nBoth hierarchical and non-hierarchical datasets are available for each cohort. In the hierarchical datasets, the counts for each concept include the visits from all descendant concepts. For example, the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes visits with Ibuprofen 600 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019073), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072), Ibuprofen 20 MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc. \n\nClinical concepts (e.g., conditions, procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO). \n\n\nThe following resources are available through this API: \n\n\n1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset descriptions, number of concepts, etc. \n\n\n2. OMOP: Access to the common vocabulary for name and concept identifier mapping\n\n\n3. Clinical Frequencies: Access to the counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of visits with the code(s) / total number of visits. \n\n\n4. Concept Associations: Inferred associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed to expected frequency, and relative frequency. \n\n\nA [Python notebook](https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/cohd_api/blob/master/notebooks/COHD_API_Example.ipynb) demonstrates simple examples of how to use the COHD API.\n\n\nCOHD was developed at the [Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) as a collaboration between the [Weng Lab](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/), [Tatonetti Lab](http://tatonettilab.org/), and the [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) program (TReK Team).
